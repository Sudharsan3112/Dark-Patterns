# Data Transparency Compliance Assessment

## Project Overview 🚀

The Data Transparency Compliance project focuses on building a robust algorithm to assess the degree of compliance of e-commerce platforms with data transparency regulations, including GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant norms applicable in India. The primary objective is to identify potential violations and provide a clear indication of the level of compliance.

## Project Scope 🌐

The project encompasses the following key aspects:

1. **Algorithm Development 🛠️:**
   - Design and implement an algorithm that evaluates e-commerce platforms for compliance with data transparency regulations.
   - Consider multiple regulatory frameworks, such as GDPR, CCPA, and any specific norms applicable in the Indian context.

2. **Degree of Compliance Assessment 📊:**
   - Establish metrics and criteria to measure the degree of compliance.
   - Develop a scoring system or classification to categorize the level of adherence to data transparency regulations.

3. **Violation Detection ⚠️:**
   - Implement mechanisms to identify potential violations of data transparency norms.
   - Provide detailed insights into specific aspects of non-compliance.

## Getting Started 🚀

Follow the steps below to set up and use the Data Transparency Compliance Assessment tool:

### Front End (Extension)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Thennavan-Hex/Dark-Patterns.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the Extension directory:

    ```bash
    cd Dark-Patterns
    ```

### Back End (Server)

1. Navigate to the Server directory:

    ```bash
    cd Server
    ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the server:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

### Usage 🖥️

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the compliance assessment algorithm:

    ```bash
    python assess_compliance.py
    ```

### Results 📈

View the results of the compliance assessment in the generated reports or logs. Take appropriate actions based on identified violations and improve the platform's data transparency practices.

## Note 📝

This project is designed to assist e-commerce platforms in enhancing their data transparency practices. It is important to regularly update the algorithm to align with evolving regulatory requirements.
